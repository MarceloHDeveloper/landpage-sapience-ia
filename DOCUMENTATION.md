## Ubiquitous Language

- **Know More Button**: Main CTA button in the hero section that initiates the presentation sequence.
- **Light Effect Transition**: Full-screen white light animation triggered by the Know More Button.
- **Header Transformation**: Process of changing the header's appearance and position during transition.
- **Hero Section**: Initial full-screen section with the main message and Know More Button.
- **Presentation Section**: New section appearing above the Hero Section after the Light Effect Transition.
- **Lottie Animation**: Animated SVG playing in the Presentation Section post-transition.
- **Particle Effect**: Interactive background animation created using Particles.js.
- **KineticType Core**: Custom JavaScript library for creating kinetic typography effects.
- **Text Animation Effect**: Any of the various text animations provided by KineticType Core (e.g., textWave, textFadeInOut, textSlideIn).
- **Effect Application**: Process of applying a text animation effect to a DOM element.
- **Effect Removal**: Process of removing an applied text animation effect from a DOM element.
- **Animation Parameters**: Customizable options for each text animation effect (e.g., amplitude, frequency, colors).
- **Phrase Transition**: Smooth transition between different text phrases using KineticType Core's addPhrase and removePhrase functions.
- **Split Text Reveal**: Special effect that reveals text character by character.
- **Gradient Shift**: Text effect that applies a moving gradient to the text color.
- **3D Text Effects**: Group of effects that give text a three-dimensional appearance (e.g., text3DExtrude, rotate3D).

## Page Flow

1. **Initial State**
   - Hero Section visible
   - Know More Button active
   - Header in initial state
   - Particle Effect active in background

2. **Transition Sequence**
   - User clicks Know More Button
   - Light Effect Transition begins
   - Header Transformation occurs
   - Hero Section hidden
   - Presentation Section slides into view

3. **Post-Transition State**
   - Presentation Section fully visible
   - Lottie Animation begins playing
   - Header in transformed state
   - Particle Effect paused or removed

## Component Descriptions

### Know More Button
- Triggers presentation sequence
- Located in Hero Section
- Has 'active' state for visual feedback

### Light Effect Transition
- Full-screen white overlay
- Fades in on Know More Button click
- Implemented with div and CSS transitions

### Header
- Transforms during transition
- Changes include color scheme, position, and z-index

### Presentation Section
- Contains Lottie Animation
- Slides into view post-transition
- Positioned above Hero Section in z-index

### Lottie Animation
- SVG-based animation
- Plays after Presentation Section is fully visible
- JSON file: `animations/animation1.json`

### Particle Effect
- Created using Particles.js
- Configurable via `particles.json`
- Provides interactive Hero Section background

## Key Functions

### `handleKnowMoreClick()`
Initiates presentation sequence on Know More Button click.

### `createFullScreenLightEffect()`
Creates and animates Light Effect Transition.

### `transitionToNextSection()`
Handles Header Transformation and Presentation Section reveal.

### `startLottieAnimation()`
Begins Lottie Animation playback in Presentation Section.

## Modules

### LottieAnimations
Manages Lottie animation loading and playback.

#### Methods
- `init()`: Loads Lottie Animation without playing.
- `play()`: Starts Lottie Animation playback.

### ParticleEffect
Controls particle background animation.

#### Methods
- `init()`: Sets up particle system.
- `pause()`: Pauses particle animation.
- `resume()`: Resumes particle animation.
- `removeConnection()`: Removes inter-particle connections.

## Event Sequence

1. DOMContentLoaded
   - Initialize Particle Effect
   - Initialize Lottie Animation (load only)
   - Set up event listeners

2. Know More Button Click
   - Trigger Light Effect Transition
   - Begin Header Transformation
   - Pause or remove Particle Effect

3. After Light Effect Transition (500ms)
   - Complete Header Transformation
   - Reveal Presentation Section
   - Start Lottie Animation

## Customization Points

- Animation durations in `createFullScreenLightEffect()`
- Lottie Animation path in `LottieAnimations.init()`
- Header transformation styles in `transitionToNextSection()`
- Particle Effect configuration in `particles.json`

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure local server setup (e.g., Live Server VS Code extension)
3. Open `public/index.html` in browser through local server

## Performance Considerations

- Asynchronous loading of Lottie animations
- Optimized Particle Effect (adjustable in `particles.json`)
- Consider lazy-loading off-screen images and animations

## Accessibility

- Ensure keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- Provide appropriate ARIA labels for dynamic content
- Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios

## Browser Compatibility

- Tested on latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Not compatible with IE11 due to ES6+ usage

## Deployment

- Host on static file server (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- Ensure proper asset linking with relative paths
- Set appropriate cache headers for static assets

## KineticType Core

KineticType Core is our proprietary JavaScript library for creating kinetic typography effects. It was specifically created for use in the Sapience-IA landpage project. This custom-built solution ensures that the text animations perfectly align with the unique design and interactive requirements of our website.

### Overview

KineticType Core was developed in-house to meet the specific needs of the Sapience-IA landpage. It offers a wide range of text animation effects that are tailored to our brand identity and user experience goals. The library is designed to be flexible, performant, and seamlessly integrated with other components of our landpage.

### Key Features

- 28+ predefined text animation effects, custom-designed for Sapience-IA's visual language
- Customizable animation parameters to fine-tune effects for different sections of the landpage
- Easy-to-use API for applying and removing effects, optimized for our development workflow
- Smooth transition handling between text phrases, crucial for our interactive storytelling approach
- Performance-optimized for smooth animations, ensuring a responsive user experience on our landpage

### Integration with Sapience-IA Landpage

KineticType Core is deeply integrated into the Sapience-IA landpage, providing dynamic text animations that enhance our brand message. It's used throughout the site, including:

1. The hero section for impactful headline animations that capture visitor attention
2. The presentation section for revealing key points about our AI and technology services
3. Various sections where text needs to be emphasized or animated to illustrate complex concepts
