## Overview

KineticType Core is a foundational JavaScript module for creating kinetic typography effects. It provides a set of customizable text animation effects and utilities for web developers to easily implement dynamic, animated text in their projects.

## Installation

1. Download the `kinetic-text-effects.js` file.
2. Place it in your project's JavaScript directory (e.g., `js/kinetic-text-effects.js`).
3. Import the module in your HTML or JavaScript file:

## HTML Test File

Included with KineticType Core is an HTML test file that demonstrates various effects and serves as a practical example of how to implement the library. This file is named `kinetic-text-effects-test.html` and should be located in your project's public directory.

### Using the Test File

1. Ensure that `kinetic-text-effects-test.html` is in your project's public directory.
2. Open the file in a web browser to see the effects in action.
3. Use this file as a reference for implementing KineticType Core in your own projects.

### Test File Contents

The test file includes examples of the following effects:

1. Text Wave Effect
2. 3D Extrude Effect
3. Color Shift Effect
4. Typewriter Effect
5. Gradient Shift Effect
6. Split Text Reveal Effect

Each effect in the test file is demonstrated with a text element and buttons to apply or remove the effect. The file also shows how to pass custom parameters to modify the animations.

### Customizing the Test File

Feel free to modify the test file to experiment with different effects or parameters. This can be a valuable tool for understanding how KineticType Core works and for prototyping your own text animations.
